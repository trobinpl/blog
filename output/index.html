<p>Recently I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTd-VcJCs_M">fantastic talk by Jimmy Bogard</a> about how to design your application, so your architecture is as SOLID as your code is. In his talk he says about CQRS and how this pattern allowed him to design his application better.</p>
<p>I have to say - this talk really inspired me. In projects I worked on it was pretty common, that there would be a <code>Repository</code> class, which had (too) many methods. In most cases one method was used in one single place. I really like the idea of bringing CQRS as cure for that.</p>            <p class="post-continue">
