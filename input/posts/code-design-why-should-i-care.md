I was working in both small businesses and big companies so far. On my path I met different kind of programmers and had a lot of convesations about how to write good code, how should we strcturize files in projects and what's the purpouse of this or that design pattern. It's really great that developers have this urge to discuss ideas with each other - this is developing for everyone! I can learn from listening, but whole new level of learing is when you have to speak about something. In this case you have to have really good understainding of subjects you're talking about, otherwise you have no chance to convice your audience to anything.

Very often subjects to talk about is code design in general. I've met people with whom I could discuss about this for hours and hours and we were leaving table knowing, that we're both smarter. The thing I was strugglng the most to understand, was people who didin't feel the need to exchange ideas and approaches. Very often when I said "Nice code, but you could split that into two classes, so it could be more readable", they response was "It works after all and you can clearly see what this code does, why should I spend more time on this?". And, of course, they didin't.

 I guess it's fair to say, that this actually **is** a valid question.
